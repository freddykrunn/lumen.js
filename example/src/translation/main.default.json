            "BODY": "It's a smooth transition from pure Javascript to Web Components. You use javascript directly to read and update the DOM, combined with the power of component based structure to reuse structured UI blocks. It is a very good way to learn the new software patterns that are the base of modern Javascript frameworks. Good for beginners and even better for advanced users who seek simplicity."
